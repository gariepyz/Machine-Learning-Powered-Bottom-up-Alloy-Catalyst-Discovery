# Multi-component-alloy-catalyst-discovery
This is the code used to discover n+1 elementt catalyst from simpler n element catalyst. Code is scalable for larger element sizes. Code used in my paper "Machine learning assisted binary alloy catalyst design for the electroreduction of CO2 to C2 products"
